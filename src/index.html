            <h4>Hi, I'm Karl. I have a background in Marketing and Advertising, as well as Customer Service and Community Management. I've now finally decided it's time for a new challenge, and am taking the plunge into web development, cloud, and cyber-security!</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests are wide-ranging, and somewhat ecclectic when you put it altogether. You can find me nose deep catching up on anything from video games to coffee; Formula 1 to cosplay; mechanical keyboards to tiny homes, and so many other things in between!
