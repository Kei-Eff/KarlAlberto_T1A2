                <h4>Hi, I'm Karl. I have a background in Marketing and Advertising, as well as Customer Service and Community Management. I've now finally decided it's time for a new challenge, and am taking the plunge into web development, cloud, and cyber-security!</h4>

            <p>
                My interests are wide-ranging, and somewhat ecclectic when you put it altogether. You can find me nose deep catching up on anything from video games to coffee; Formula 1 to cosplay; mechanical keyboards to tiny homes, and so many other things in between!

            <p>
                I'm generally soft-spoken and introverted in real life. Put me behind on a keyboard and monitor though, and I can get fairly chatty. If you do see me out and about though, you can talk to me - I'm shy, not completely anti-social <em>(I think)</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life is currently a balancing act between study and parenthood, but I'm keen to get back into the office life once I've acquired some more skills. Keep an eye out for my CV in your inbox soon!
