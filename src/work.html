            <p>
                Hi, I'm Karl. I am currently studying at Coder Academy, enrolled in the 'Code, Cloud & Cyber' Bootcamp. I'm aspiring to join Australia's IT industry, with a goal towards DevOps! The content has been very engaging, and has given me a chance to add some new tools to my problem-solving repertoire. I look forward to applying all I've learnt in a future IT role!
